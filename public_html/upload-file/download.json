Having staff knowledgeable of secure coding guidelines should minimize the number of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor coding practices. Training for developers may be provided in-house or by third parties and should be applicable for technology used.\r\nAs industry-accepted secure coding practices change, organizational coding practices and developer training should likewise be updated to address new threats—for example, memory scraping attacks.\r\nThe vulnerabilities identified in 6.5.1 through 6.5.10 provide a minimum baseline. It is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and incorporate appropriate measures into their secure coding practices."
